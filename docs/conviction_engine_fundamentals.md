# Conviction Engine — Fundamental Agent (Status & Operations)

This document describes how the **fundamental conviction** layer works today, what we **assume**, and how to **run and verify** it. It aligns with the implementation plan at `.cursor/plans/conviction_engine_79da0f8e.plan.md` and the v5 PDF conceptually (batch overlay + JSON store); the PDF is not modified in-repo.

## Current status (verified in this workspace)

- **Entry point:** `scripts/update_conviction_fundamentals.py` — scheduled job to pull **yfinance** data, update `conviction_store/{TICKER}.json`, optionally refresh overlay CSVs under `conviction_store/overlays/`.
- **Data path:** `fetch_yfinance_fundamentals` → `fundamentals_enriched.fetch_and_compute_fundamentals` (quarterly statements, TTM sums, trailing P/E series, dividend stats, retries on thin `info`).
- **Scoring:** `full_recalculation` / `daily_update` in `src/conviction_engine/engine.py`; rules in `src/conviction_engine/scoring.py`.
- **Last full run:** `--mode full --write-overlays` for **166** tickers — batch **status completed, 0 thrown errors**; **no `fetch_errors`** returned on ticker results.
- **Equity scores (typical auto universe):** `conviction_score` often falls in a band like **roughly -8 to +8** depending on the tape and tax caps; **BQ raw** can span a wider range. Counts exactly at **-1 / 0 / +1** are a **minority**, not the bulk distribution.
- **Overlay contract:** Original `trade_store` CSVs unchanged; overlays appended alongside (e.g. `*_conviction.csv`).

## Architecture (batch)

1. Discover tickers from latest `trade_store/US` signal files (+ optional universe / flags).
2. Fetch enriched fundamentals per ticker (`info` + mapped fields + non-fatal `errors` list).
3. **Full:** refresh static BQ, copy fundamentals into record, run `daily_update` for valuation fields. **Daily:** refresh price-sensitive fields from latest fetch.
4. If `--write-overlays`, run `apply_to_signal_file` on latest signal sources.

### Daily automation (after signal reports)

**Script:** `scripts/run_conviction_engine_daily.py` (also invoked from `update_trade_data.sh` after trade_store sync).

Each run:

1. Resolves report date from `YYYY-MM-DD_all_signal.csv` (or `--report-date`).
2. Refreshes `conviction_store/{TICKER}.json` (default `--fundamentals-mode daily`).
3. Overlays conviction columns onto daily signal CSVs (`all_signal`, `new_signal`, `outstanding_signal`, `claude_signals_report`, `target_signal`, virtual trading).
4. Archives under **`conviction_store/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/`**:
   - `{report}_conviction.csv` — full report + conviction columns
   - `{report}_conviction_scores.csv` — compact score sheet (`conviction_score`, `verdict`, `fs_class`, …)
   - `manifest.json` — per-report summaries and paths
   - `daily_report.txt` — universe alert summary
5. Updates **`conviction_store/overlays/`** latest files for the Streamlit Conviction Engine page.

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_conviction_engine_daily.py --fundamentals-mode daily
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_conviction_engine_daily.py --report-date 2026-05-15 --skip-fundamentals
```

## Fundamental inputs: what is used, why it matters, how it is fetched

This section ties **stored JSON fields** to **yfinance sources** and the **formulas** in `fundamentals_enriched.py`, `engine.py` (`daily_update`), and `scoring.py`.

### How data is fetched (pipeline)

1. **`fetch_yfinance_enriched`** (`fundamentals_enriched.py`): builds a `yfinance.Ticker(symbol)`, with retries if `info` is empty. Pulls:
   - **`info`** — consolidated metadata (sector, margins, EPS, cashflow hints, `quoteType`, etc.).
   - **`fast_info`** — spot **`last_price`** / **`market_cap`** when available.
   - **`history(period="5y")`** — daily **Close** for dividend-yield statistics and trailing P/E history.
   - **`dividends`** — cash dividends aligned to price history.
   - **Quarterly statements**: **`quarterly_income_stmt`**, **`quarterly_balance_sheet`**, **`quarterly_cashflow`** — used for TTM sums and trends.

2. **`build_fundamentals_from_raw`**: maps the above into a flat **`fundamentals`** dict passed into the engine (see table below).

3. **`map_to_engine_fundamentals`**: drops nulls; may substitute **`gross_margin_computed`** when yfinance `grossMargins` is missing.

4. **`full_recalculation`**: merges `info` + `fundamentals`, sets **`business_type`**, computes **`bq_components`** / **`bq_raw`**, copies fields into the JSON record, then calls **`daily_update`**.

5. **`daily_update`** (and every overlay via **`modify_signal`**): refreshes **price-sensitive** ratios (**`pe_ttm`**, **`ev_fwd_rev`**, **`owner_earnings_yield`**, **`dividend_yield_current`**), recomputes **`valuation_tax`**, **`conviction_score`**, **`fs_score`**, **`fs_class`**, **`yield_trap_warning`**.

**Significance:** fundamentals answer “quality and valuation of the business **right now** (per yfinance)” so conviction can **overlay** quant signals. This is **not** a point-in-time archive unless you snapshot JSON historically.

### Primary inputs after fetch (engine `fundamentals` / record fields)

| Field(s) | Typical source(s) | Role / significance |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| **`quote_type`**, **`sector`**, **`industry`** | `info` | **Asset gate** (`EQUITY` vs ETF/index/crypto). **Business type** heuristics (saas / income / cyclical / compounder) for sector-appropriate valuation tiers and WACC used in ROIC spread. |
| **`price`**, **`market_cap`** | `fast_info` / `info` | **Market cap** drives **`enterprise_value`**, **`owner_earnings_yield`**, **`ev_fwd_rev`**, **`pe_ttm`**, live **dividend yield**. |
| **`eps_ttm`**, **`eps_fwd`** | `info.trailingEps`, quarterly net income / shares | **`pe_ttm`** = price / EPS; feeds **P/E percentile** vs built-up history. |
| **`fwd_revenue_stored`** | Sum of last **4 quarters** revenue (preferred), reconciled with `info.totalRevenue` if TTM looks wrong | **EV/revenue** = enterprise value / revenue — core **valuation tax** lens by business type. |
| **`fcf_ttm`** | Operating cash flow TTM + capex TTM (capex usually negative in yfinance, so **OCF + capex**), else `info.freeCashflow` | **FCF margin**, **distribution coverage**, **`owner_earnings_yield`** = FCF / market cap. |
| **`fcf_margin`** | `fcf_ttm / revenue_base` | **Rule of 40** style **margin_quality** for non-income types. |
| **`gross_margin`** | `info.grossMargins` or gross profit TTM / revenue TTM | **Revenue quality** and margin quality tie-ins. |
| **`net_debt_stored`** | Balance sheet debt minus cash (latest quarter row) | With **`market_cap`**: **EV** = market cap + net debt (net debt defaults 0 if null). |
| **`net_debt_ebitda`** | `net_debt / EBITDA` (TTM or `info.ebitda`) | **Balance sheet** score uses type-specific leverage bands. |
| **`roic_proxy`** | `returnOnEquity` or `returnOnAssets` (normalized % vs decimal), else NI/equity from statements | Compared to **type WACC** → **roic_wacc_spread** BQ points. |
| **`revenue_growth`**, **`revenue_accelerating`** | YoY change latest quarter vs 5 quarters back; last 3Q monotonicity | **Growth trajectory** BQ dimension. |
| **`gross_margin_trend`** | Change in gross margin % over ~5 quarters | **gross_margin_trend** BQ points. |
| **`distribution_coverage_ratio`** | `fcf_ttm / (dividendRate * shares)` | For **income** types, **margin_quality** from payout sustainability. |
| **`annual_div_per_share_stored`** | `dividendRate` / trailing annual | **`dividend_yield_current`** = div / price; **yield trap** z-score vs 5Y history. |
| **`dividend_yield_5y_mean`**, **`dividend_yield_5y_std`** | 5Y rolling sum of dividends / price | **Yield trap**: high current yield vs own history + exchange threshold. |
| **`pe_20y_array`** | **`history(period='max')`**: daily **P/E = that day’s close ÷ rolling 4Q EPS**; stored as **month-end** samples (up to ~240 points). | **Percentile** of today’s **`pe_ttm`** within that series → valuation tax. |
| **`pe_history_meta`** | Calendar span of valid P/E points: `years_available`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `insufficient_20y` if &lt; **20** years | Flags + universe distribution; see below. |
| **`insider_pct`** | `heldPercentInsiders` scaled to **0–100** if given as a fraction | **insider_ownership** BQ via thresholds (>15% good, &lt;1% bad). |

---

### Derived quantities in `daily_update` (math)

Let **P** = price, **M** = market cap, **D** = net debt (stored or 0), **R** = `fwd_revenue_stored`, **FCF** = `fcf_ttm`, **EPS** = `eps_ttm`.

| Quantity | Formula / rule | Use |
| -------- | -------------- | --- |
| **`enterprise_value`** | `enterprise_value = market_cap + net_debt` (net debt defaults to 0 if missing) | Less noisy “firm value” than equity-only cap. |
| **`pe_ttm`** | `pe_ttm = price / eps_ttm` when EPS > 0 | Current trailing P/E. |
| **`pe_percentile_20y`** | Fraction of `pe_20y_array` values ≤ current `pe_ttm`, times 100 | “How expensive vs recent own history” (field name is legacy). |
| **`ev_fwd_rev`** | `(market_cap + net_debt) / fwd_revenue_stored` when revenue > 0 | Richness vs sales; valuation tax tiers depend on `business_type`. |
| **`owner_earnings_yield`** | `fcf_ttm / market_cap` when both known and cap > 0 | Cash return on equity value; very low yield adds valuation tax. |
| **`dividend_yield_current`** | `annual_div_per_share_stored / price` | Current yield vs 5Y stats → z-score for yield trap gate. |
| **`conviction_score`** | `bq_raw + valuation_tax` (rounded) | Stored headline score before FS overlay cap in `modify_signal`. |

---

### Business type → valuation tier sets (`EV_REV_TIERS` in `scoring.py`)

**`business_type`** selects threshold list **`[t1,t2,t3,t4]`** (EV/revenue) and optional **`floor_trigger`**:

| Type | EV/rev thresholds (must cross in order) | `floor_trigger` (note) |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **saas** | 3, 5, 8, 12 | 4 |
| **compounder** | 1.5, 3, 6, 8 | 3 |
| **income** | 4, 6, 8, 10 | 6 |
| **cyclical** | 1, 2.5, 4, 5 | None |
| **unknown** | 2, 4, 6, 8 | None |

**EV/revenue tier tax:** let the tier list be `[t1, t2, t3, t4]`. Initialize `tier_tax = 0`. For each index **i** from 1 to 4, if `ev_fwd_rev >= t_i`, set `tier_tax = -i` (so the deepest breached threshold wins). Add `tier_tax` to total tax. If `ev_fwd_rev` is at or above the **last** threshold, set `tax = min(tax, -5)` (extra pinch at the top). **Income** only: if `ev_fwd_rev` is **below** the **first** threshold, add **+1** to tax.

**P/E percentile tax** (on current P/E vs stored history): if percentile ≥ 85% → **−3**; elif ≥ 70% → **−2**; elif ≥ 55% → **−1** (single branch — not stacked across bands).

**Owner earnings yield:** if `owner_earnings_yield < 1%` (0.01) → add **−2** to tax.

**Clamp:** `valuation_tax = round(max(-5, min(0, tax)), 2)` — never positive, never more negative than **−5** in total.

**Why:** combine **multiple** expensive signals without letting the raw sum explode past the v5-style cap.

---

### Auto BQ (`compute_bq_components_auto` + `bq_raw`)

**`bq_raw` = sum of 15 components** (each is a small integer-like score, then rounded).

| Component | Main inputs | Scoring idea (abbrev.) |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| **revenue_quality** | gross_margin, fcf_margin | Higher gross / FCF margin → up to +2 each branch, cap +2. |
| **growth_trajectory** | revenue_growth, revenue_accelerating | YoY and accel flags → −1 … +2. |
| **margin_quality** | business_type, dist_cov OR rule_of_40, fcf_margin, gross_margin | Income: coverage &gt;2 → +2, etc.; else Rule of 40 (%): ≥40 → +2, ≥25 → +1, etc. |
| **balance_sheet** | net_debt_ebitda vs **type bands** (`NET_DEBT_SAFE` / `CONCERN` / `DANGER`) | Safe → +1, stretched → 0 / −1 / −2. |
| **roic_wacc_spread** | roic_proxy minus **WACC** (saas 10%, compounder 7.5%, income 5.5%, cyclical 9%, unknown 8%) | Spread ≥5% → +2, ≥2% → +1, &gt;0 → 0, etc. |
| **gross_margin_trend** | gross_margin_trend | ≥+2% rel. → +1, ≤−2% → −1. |
| **debt_maturity_risk** | override | default 0. |
| **ceo_quality**, **mgmt_capital_allocation**, **competitive_moat**, **macro_tailwind** | overrides / scores | default **0** unless manual JSON. |
| **divergence_signal**, **deal_delay_risk** | override flags | 0 or ±2 / −1. |
| **insider_ownership** | insider % (0–100) | &gt;15% → +2, &lt;1% → −1. |
| **reinvestment_runway** | override multiple | ≥5 → +1, &lt;3 → −1. |

If **every** auto component is **0**, **`full_recalculation`** falls back to legacy **`compute_bq_components`** (simpler thresholds on the same fundamentals).

**`fs_quality_base`** = **`50 + bq_raw × 2.5`** (starting point for financial strength score).

---

### Financial strength score (`calculate_fs_score`) → `fs_class`

Starting score = **`fs_quality_base`** (or override). Then adjustments (examples):

- **Owner earnings yield** vs **OEY_STRONG** by type (e.g. compounder 4%): strong → **+5**; very weak (&lt;1%) → **−8**.
- **P/E percentile**: ≤30 → **+5**; ≥80 → **−6**.
- **EV/revenue**: ≥ top tier → **−8**; &lt; first tier → **+3**.

Clamp to **[0, 100]**, then **classify**: ≥75 strong, ≥55 moderate_high, ≥40 moderate, ≥25 moderate_low, else weak.

**`apply_fs_cap`** then may **lower** the conviction used for verdicts if **fs_class** is weak/moderate_low (long vs short caps differ).

---

### `fd_direction` (sizing nudge, not BQ)

From **`compute_fd_direction`**: votes from **revenue_growth** (&gt;2% / &lt;−2%), optional EPS growth (not populated from fetch by default), **gross_margin_trend** (&gt;1% / &lt;−1%) → **positive** / **negative** / **stable**. Used only inside **TACTICAL / REDUCED BUY** sizing bands.

---

## Meaning and significance of conviction scores

### What the numbers are

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| **`bq_raw`** | Sum of **15 Business Quality (BQ)** dimension scores (roughly -15 … +30 in principle; typical auto-calibrated band is narrower). Higher = better franchise / balance sheet / growth / returns **before** adjusting for how expensive the stock is. Many dimensions default to **0** until you add **manual overrides** (CEO, moat, etc.). |
| **`valuation_tax`** | Non-positive adjustment for **rich** valuation vs business type (EV/revenue tiers, trailing P/E percentile, very low owner-earnings yield). Ranges from **0** down to a **floor of -5** (total tax is capped there so one expensive lens does not dominate). |
| **`conviction_score`** (in JSON store) | **`bq_raw` + `valuation_tax`** (rounded). This is the **uncapped** headline fundamental score used as input to the next steps. |

So a **high positive** score means: strong or decent BQ **and** valuation not punishing too hard. A **deep negative** score usually means weak BQ and/or heavy valuation tax (expensive vs fundamentals).

### How to read the magnitude (interpretive bands)

These bands describe **economic significance** in this implementation, not a guarantee of future performance:

| Approx. `conviction_score` | Interpretation |
| -------------------------: | -------------- |
| **&lt; 0** | Fundamentals **do not support** sizing into a typical long on fundamental grounds alone: weak BQ and/or punitive valuation tax. Often pairs with **CANCEL BUY** on new longs after FS and other gates. |
| **0 … 1.99** | **Marginal**: some BQ may be fine, but valuation drag and/or weak FS path keeps you **below** the first “actionable” BUY tier in the verdict map (needs **≥ 2** after any FS cap). |
| **2 … 4.99** | **Moderate alignment**: crosses the **REDUCED BUY** threshold **if** the score fed into `modify_signal` is **≥ 2** after **FS caps** (see below). Good businesses can sit here when still somewhat expensive. |
| **5 … 7.99** | **Strong alignment**: crosses **TACTICAL BUY** if the **post-cap** score **≥ 5**. Usually needs solid BQ and a valuation tax that is not maxed out (or strong overrides). |
| **≥ 8** | **Maximum fundamental tier** (**MAX CONVICTION** for buys). In practice, reaching **8+** with **only** automated yfinance inputs is **uncommon** because subjective BQ scores and extreme “cheapness” are often required; **manual BQ** and/or very favorable valuation help. |

**Negative scores** are **meaningful**, not errors: they say “fundamentals argue against paying up,” which is by design when tax and BQ both lean negative.

### Verdict mapping (after FS cap): BUY side

The engine applies **`apply_fs_cap`** so **weak** or **moderate-low** financial strength can **lower** the score before sizing. Overlay columns:

- **`conviction_raw`** ≈ pre-cap score from the record  
- **`conviction_score`** = **post-FS-cap** score used for **`verdict`** and **`sizing_pct`**

Thresholds (from `verdict_for_buy`, yield-trap excluded):

| Post-cap score | BUY verdict | Suggested sizing (conceptual) |
| -------------: | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| **≥ 8** | MAX CONVICTION | 100% of framework bucket |
| **≥ 5** | TACTICAL BUY | 60–85% (depends on `fd_direction`) |
| **≥ 2** | REDUCED BUY | 25–50% (depends on `fd_direction`) |
| **&lt; 2** | CANCEL BUY | 0% |

**Yield-trap** (`yield_trap_warning`): hard **CANCEL BUY** / zero sizing regardless of score.

**`fd_direction`** (`positive` / `negative` / `stable`): nudges sizing **within** the REDUCED / TACTICAL bands; it does **not** change the tier boundaries.

### Financial strength (`fs_class`) — why scores get “stuck” in overlays

`fs_score` / `fs_class` come from a **separate** 0–100 scale (`calculate_fs_score` / `classify_fs`). If FS is **weak** or **moderate_low**, **`apply_fs_cap`** can cap the long/short **conviction_score** used for verdicts (e.g. weak + long-term signal capped at **+1**). That can make overlays look “all 0 or 1” even when **`conviction_raw`** is higher — always compare **`conviction_raw`**, **`bq_raw`**, **`valuation_tax`**, and the **rationale** column.

### SELL side (short signal)

For **SELL** signals, the same underlying score drives **pause vs exit** logic (`verdict_for_sell`): higher conviction supports **pausing** or **trading around** a short exit; lower conviction favors **full / hard** exit. Interpretation is symmetric to risk tolerance: “how much does fundamental quality argue for keeping vs exiting the position?”

### Non-equities

ETF / index / FX / crypto: **`conviction_score`** is **`null`** in JSON; overlays use **NOT_APPLICABLE**. There is **no** fundamental equity score to interpret.

## Assumptions

1. **Primary source** for automated fundamentals is **yfinance**; the JSON / overlay **shape** is stable so other providers can supply the same fields later.
2. **Non-equities** (ETF, index, FX, crypto) get **no** numeric equity conviction score in the same sense; gating uses asset type + `NOT_APPLICABLE` where appropriate.
3. **`pe_20y_array`** is a **legacy name**: the implementation builds a **recent trailing P/E history** from rolling four-quarter EPS vs spot prices, not a full multi-decade Macrotrends series.
4. **Subjective BQ items** (CEO, moat, etc.) score **0** unless **manual overrides** are set — consistent with an analyst workflow in the PDF.
5. **Valuation tax** is non-positive, **capped at -5** total; extreme EV/revenue floor applies at the **top EV/rev tier** only.
6. **`heldPercentInsiders` / `insider_pct`** is normalized to a **0–100 percent** scale for auto-BQ (e.g. `0.065` → `6.5`) so insider scoring matches `_score_insider`.

## Implementation notes (recent)

- **Auto BQ** (`compute_bq_components_auto`) with **fallback** to legacy `compute_bq_components` when every auto component is zero (sparse data).
- **Retries** when `Ticker.info` is empty or flaky.
- **Business type:** e.g. “Software – Infrastructure” not misclassified as income purely on the word “infrastructure”; dividend yield normalization for yfinance percent vs decimal.
- **`fd_direction`:** inferred from revenue growth and gross margin trend when not overridden; `_copy_known_fields` no longer resets it to a stale default.
- **`insider_pct`:** stored on **0–100** scale after fetch for consistent `_score_insider` thresholds.

## How to run

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# Full refresh + overlays
.venv/bin/python scripts/update_conviction_fundamentals.py --mode full --write-overlays

# Price-sensitive only
.venv/bin/python scripts/update_conviction_fundamentals.py --mode daily --write-overlays
```

## How to verify

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m unittest tests.test_conviction_engine -v
```

Inspect JSON under `conviction_store/` for `conviction_score`, `bq_raw`, `valuation_tax`, `fetch_errors`. Successful runs should show **`fetch_errors`: []** or absent; batch JSON should report **`errors`: 0`.

### Verification checklist (last automated pass)

Use this as a repeatability checklist after a full `--mode full --write-overlays` run:

| Check | Expected |
| ----- | -------- |
| Unit tests `tests.test_conviction_engine` | All pass |
| EQUITY JSON records | Each has numeric `conviction_score` (non-equities use `null`) |
| Identity | Stored `conviction_score` == `bq_raw` + `valuation_tax` (two decimals) |
| `fetch_errors` on records | Empty or absent when yfinance responded normally |
| `data_coverage` / `missing_fields` | Present after full recalc; `coverage_ratio` reflects `CRITICAL_FIELDS` in `data_coverage.py` |
| Non-equities | `conviction_score` is `null` in JSON; overlays use `NOT_APPLICABLE` |
| Overlay CSV `conviction_score` “NaN” rows | Should be **only** ETF / INDEX / CURRENCY / CRYPTO rows (pandas empty for `null`); equity rows should be numeric |
| `conviction_score` vs overlay cap | Overlay column may be **FS-capped** vs store raw; see `conviction_raw` and rationale column |

Example spot-check: live `fetch_yfinance_fundamentals("AAPL")` should return **0** `fetch_errors` and populated keys such as `eps_ttm`, `fcf_ttm`, `fwd_revenue_stored`, `gross_margin`, `market_cap`.

## Backtesting conviction vs signal MTM

Use **`scripts/backtest_conviction_signals.py`** to compare two **dated exports** of the **same report type** (for example `*_outstanding_signal.csv`):

1. **Historical** file: signals and MTM as of report date T1.  
2. **Forward** file: same logical rows matched on `Function` + compound symbol line; outcome is the **forward** file’s **“Today … % vs Signal”** column (MTM vs original signal price as of T2).

The script attaches **`conviction_raw`** from the **current** `conviction_store` (today’s fundamentals), then reports:

- **Correlation** (Pearson and rank-based Spearman) between `conviction_raw` and forward % vs signal for **EQUITY / BUY** rows that matched T1→T2.  
- **Bucket summary**: mean / median / win-rate (`% vs signal` > 0) by conviction band (`<0`, `[0,2)`, `[2,5)`, `>=5`).

### Important limitations

- This is **not** a point-in-time fundamental backtest unless you rebuild `conviction_store` with historical fundamentals (not implemented here). Scores answer: “given **today’s** model, did higher conviction align with **later-reported** quant MTM?”  
- Rows must **exist in both** files with the **same** key; additions/removals between exports reduce the matched set.  
- If historical and forward paths are the **same file**, `same_file_warning` is true: correlations are still defined but **forward MTM equals historical** (not a time evolution).

### Example

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/backtest_conviction_signals.py \\
  --historical trade_store/US/2026-04-01_outstanding_signal.csv \\
  --forward trade_store/US/2026-05-14_outstanding_signal.csv \\
  --output-csv reports/conviction_backtest_detail.csv \\
  --output-json reports/conviction_backtest_summary.json
```

Resolve historical path by date:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/backtest_conviction_signals.py \\
  --from-date 2026-04-01 \\
  --report-base outstanding_signal.csv
```

(Forward file defaults to the **latest** dated `*_<report-base>` under `trade_store/US`.)

Core logic: `src/conviction_engine/backtest.py`.

## Data linkage, redundancy, and missing data

### Fallback chains (critical stored fields)

| Field | Primary | Secondary | Tertiary | If all absent |
| ----- | ------- | --------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `price` | `fast_info.last_price` | `info.currentPrice` / `regularMarketPrice` | `previousClose` | Omitted; daily update may skip `pe_ttm` |
| `market_cap` | `fast_info.market_cap` | `info.marketCap` | — | Omitted; EV / yield branches skipped |
| `eps_ttm` | Quarterly net income TTM / shares | `info.trailingEps` | — | Omitted; no `pe_ttm` |
| `fcf_ttm` | OCF TTM + capex TTM | `info.freeCashflow` | — | Omitted; FCF margin / owner earnings weak |
| `fwd_revenue_stored` | 4Q revenue sum | `info.totalRevenue` (ADR sanity) | — | Omitted; no `ev_fwd_rev` tax branch |
| `net_debt_stored` | Balance sheet debt − cash | — | — | Omitted; **defaults to 0** in `daily_update` EV |
| `pe_20y_array` | `history(max)` price vs rolling 4Q EPS | — | — | Omitted; **no P/E percentile penalty** |
| `dividend_yield_5y_mean/std` | 5Y div / price history | — | — | Omitted; yield-trap z-score skipped |
| Subjective BQ (CEO, moat, …) | Manual overrides only | — | — | Score **0** (neutral) |

Implementation: `_first_not_none` chains in `fundamentals_enriched.build_fundamentals_from_raw`; per-step `try/except` appends to `fetch_errors` without aborting the batch.

### BQ dimension ↔ inputs (auto path)

| BQ component | Fundamental inputs | Notes |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----- |
| `revenue_quality` | `gross_margin`, `fcf_margin` | Neutral 0 if missing |
| `growth_trajectory` | `revenue_growth`, optional `revenue_accelerating` | |
| `margin_quality` | `revenue_growth`, `fcf_margin`, `distribution_coverage_ratio`, `gross_margin` | Type-aware in scorer |
| `balance_sheet` | `net_debt_ebitda` | Bands by `business_type` |
| `roic_wacc_spread` | `roic_proxy` or `roic` | vs type WACC |
| `gross_margin_trend` | `gross_margin_trend` | |
| `insider_ownership` | `insider_pct` | |
| `ceo_quality`, `mgmt_capital_allocation`, `competitive_moat`, `macro_tailwind`, `debt_maturity_risk`, `divergence_signal`, `deal_delay_risk`, `reinvestment_runway` | Overrides only | **Always 0** without manual JSON overrides |
| All auto zero | — | `full_recalculation` falls back to legacy `compute_bq_components` |

**Neutral-zero policy:** Missing inputs add **0** to `bq_raw`; scores are **not** re-normalized by `%` of dimensions with data. Sparse names can look “average” when many dims are empty. This pass **reports** coverage only; it does not rescale `conviction_score`.

### Valuation tax when inputs are missing

`calculate_valuation_tax` skips branches when inputs are absent:

- No `ev_fwd_rev` → no EV/revenue tier penalty (can be **less negative** than full data).
- No `pe_percentile_20y` → no historical P/E percentile penalty.
- No `owner_earnings_yield` → no earnings-yield branch.

`net_debt_stored` null is treated as **0** when computing enterprise value, which can **understate** EV.

### What is recorded on each JSON record

| Field | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| `fetch_errors` | Non-fatal yfinance step failures from last fetch |
| `data_coverage` | Structured report: `coverage_ratio`, `low_data_confidence`, `statements`, `valuation_inputs`, `bq_auto_dimensions`, `fields_missing` |
| `missing_fields` | Flat sorted list for UI/search (includes `valuation:*` and `fetch:*` prefixes) |
| Null valuation fields | e.g. `pe_percentile_20y` null when `pe_20y_array` absent |

`low_data_confidence` is true when: non-empty `fetch_errors`, empty/thin `info`, `coverage_ratio` &lt; **0.45**, or missing `ev_fwd_rev`. Logic lives in `src/conviction_engine/data_coverage.py`.

### How to audit a ticker

1. Open `conviction_store/{TICKER}.json`.
2. Check `data_coverage.coverage_ratio` and `low_data_confidence`.
3. Read `missing_fields` and `data_coverage.fetch_errors`.
4. Inspect nulls on `pe_percentile_20y`, `dividend_yield_zscore`, `ev_fwd_rev`.
5. Expand `data_coverage.bq_auto_dimensions` for per-dimension `inputs_missing`.

Re-run full fundamentals to refresh coverage after code changes:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/update_conviction_fundamentals.py --mode full
```

### Limitations

- Not point-in-time historical fundamentals unless you snapshot JSON externally.
- Wrong but non-null values are **not** detected as corrupt.
- No automatic score rescaling by coverage in this release.

### P/E history length flag (&lt; 20 years)

The valuation tax’s **P/E percentile** branch compares today’s `pe_ttm` to a trailing P/E series built from yfinance **`max`** price history and quarterly EPS. Each equity record stores:

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `pe_history_meta.years_available` | Calendar years from first to last valid daily P/E point |
| `pe_history_meta.insufficient_20y` | `true` when `years_available` &lt; **20** (target for “full” historical percentile) |
| `pe_history_meta.price_years_available` | Years of raw price data fetched |
| `pe_history_meta.eps_quarters` / `eps_years_available` | Quarterly EPS depth (often the binding limit for IPOs) |
| `data_coverage.pe_history` | Copy of the above on each coverage refresh |
| `missing_fields` | Includes `pe_history:insufficient_20y (Xy)` when under 20 years |

**Universe distribution** (how many names lack 20Y history, histogram by years):

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/report_pe_history_coverage.py
# or after a full refresh:
.venv/bin/python scripts/update_conviction_fundamentals.py --mode full --pe-history-report
```

JSON summary fields: `total_equity_records`, `insufficient_20y_count`, `insufficient_20y_pct`, `years_distribution` (buckets `0`, `0-2`, `2-5`, …, `20+`).

**UI:** Conviction Engine → **Charts** tab → “P/E history coverage (universe)” bar chart and per-ticker table.

**Interpretation:** Names with `insufficient_20y: true` still get a percentile vs **whatever history exists**; the flag means the comparison is **not** a full 20-year regime. Recent IPOs, thin EPS filings, or missing statements often land in `0-5` year buckets. Re-run **`--mode full`** after deploy so `pe_history_meta` is populated (legacy records with only `pe_20y_array` show `legacy_no_meta` until refreshed).

## Gaps vs PDF (explicit)

- No live `trade_arrival_analysis` dispatcher in-repo; integration is **batch CSV overlay**.
- No replacement for **manual** 15-dimension analyst scores except overrides.
- No external **long-history PE** vendor unless added later.
